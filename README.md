 I created this portfolio webpage to showcase some of my data science and video game projects. I made the site from scratch using VS Code  and pure HTML code. I made it responsive on most devices, also used CSS style sheet extensively, provide links with tooltips to deployed projects and git repos. I attempted to emulate how Bootstrap looks and respondswithout using their code, or library. Also recreated my resume entirely in HTML, as included link to PDF version. 
<br><br>
Each of my projects is contained within a rectangular card, with a project title, image, and text summary.  I added a few stylistic visuals like highlight and drop shadows on each project card. The site uses a column design, so depending on screen size or orientation the projects will be viewable in one stacked column, or in two columns side by side. Further I used the saturation filter to increase the page's color vibrancy. Also created a custom icon (for project deploy links), unique background, and banner using Microsoft Word's shapes and icons!  This site is best viewed on chrome. I really had fun putting this together, I learned a lot, please enjoy!
